# Predictive Modeling

In this project I look at a dataset containing approximately 2,200 records of baseball teams and their perforances each year from 1876 to 2006. I clean the data of outliers, NAs, etc. and make sure our data structures are correct. I visualize the data through boxplots and histograms to inspect the distribution. Once the data is prepared, I construct a linear regression model to predict a given teams performance. While constructing my model, I incorporate a few popular regression techniques such as lasso regression, boostrap regression and ridge regression and compare results.
