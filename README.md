## Predictive Modeling

<i>In this project, I look at a dataset containing approximately 2,200 records of baseball teams and their performances each year from 1876 to 2006. I clean the data of outliers, NAs, etc., and make sure our data structures are correct. I visualize the data through boxplots and histograms to inspect the distribution. Once the data is prepared, I construct a linear regression model to predict a teamâ€™s performance. While constructing my model, I incorporate a few popular regression techniques such as lasso regression, bootstrap regression, ridge regression, and then compare results.</i>
